My Guix System and Home configurations, plus dotfiles.

## Guix-less stuff
Here is a list of software/other stuff I have installed that is not managed by Guix Home/System (but should be in the future!):
- fonts (FiraCode Nerd Font is not yet a package)
- flutter (SDK was extracted into to ~/src/ following these instructions: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/web)
